### Objective:

In this project, you will learn how to build and deploy a full stack social media app using the MERN stack, which consists of MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. You will also implement features such as authentication, pagination, and comments to enhance the functionality and user experience of your app.

The main objectives of this project are:

- To create a backend server using Node.js and Express that handles requests from the frontend and interacts with the MongoDB database.
- To design a MongoDB schema that stores user information, posts, and comments.
- To use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and bcrypt to implement authentication and authorization for users to sign up, log in, and access protected routes.
- To use React Hooks and Context API to manage the state of your app and perform CRUD operations on posts and comments.
- To use React Router to navigate between different pages of your app.
- To use Material UI and custom CSS to style your app and make it responsive.
- To use Axios to make HTTP requests from the frontend to the backend.
- To use React Paginate to implement pagination for displaying posts in pages.
- To deploy your app to Vercel and connect it to MongoDB Atlas, a cloud database service.
